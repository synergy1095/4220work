# Homework

In this assignment you are to create a Vue.js application that allows a User to:

- **25pts** - Fetch all available categories and dynamically display them.
- **20pts** - Fetch a random Chuck Norris fact from _any_ category, including _all_.
- **20pts** - Search Chuck Norris facts and return all facts that match the search query.
	- **10pts** -`highlight` the search string in each of your search results.
- **25pts** - See a history of all search queries that were submitted for the given session.
	- NOTE: You do not need to persist the history if the User closes their browser or navigates away from your site.

Your page should dynamically update to display a single fact or a list of search results.  Search results and random facts should never be shown simultaneously.

		The Chuck Norris API can be found here: https://api.chucknorris.io
