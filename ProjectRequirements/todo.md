## To-Do

Your To-Do application should allow Users to create a project, and within the project create To-Do’s

Your UI must allow Users to do the following:

- See a list of all projects
- Navigate into a project and view all To-Do’s associated with the project.
- Add a new To Do
- Toggle an existing To Do between done and not done.
- Remove all completed To Do’s.

### Extra Credit- Synchronization (10 pts)
- Whenever a project or To Do is created, modified, or deleted, the UI should be updated in real-time.
- To receive credit - you must accomplish this with WebSockets.
